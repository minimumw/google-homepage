Google homepage project for The Odin Project

project completed, in a state i'm content with

not very responsive, which is something i should look into. lots of break points as screen gets smaller

think some of this had to do with the project being left in a kinda messy place when i dropped it to go through tutorial after tutorial after tutorial

took a lot of tutorial grind to understand concepts, but finally get a decent grip on flexbox and how to center things

still want a better understanding of why things do what they do, i.e. what does setting a margin to auto actually mean. not just knowing that margin: 0 auto will center a div

impressed with how well i was able to incorporate images into the design without too much headache once i understood display properties

need to develop my own structure for tackling a page design. drawing and mapping things out on paper seems super helpful
